    abstract = { A few billion years have passed since the first life forms appeared. Since then, life has continued to forge complex associations between the different emergent levels of interconnection it forms. The advances of recent decades in molecular chemistry and theoretical biology, which have embraced complex systems approaches, now make it possible to conceptualize the questions of the origins of life and its increasing complexity from three complementary notions of closure: processes closure, autocatalytic closure and constraints closure. Developed in the wake of the second-order cybernetics, this triple closure approach, that relies on graph theory and complex networks science, sketch a paradigm where it is possible to go up the physical levels of organization of matter, from physics to biology and society, without resorting to strong reductionism. The phenomenon of life is conceived as the contingent complexification of the organization of matter, until the emergence of life forms, defined as a network of auto-catalytic process networks, organized in a multi-level manner. This approach of living systems, initiated by Maturana \&amp; Varela and Kauffman, inevitably leads to a reflection on the nature of cognition; and in the face of the deep changes that affected humanity as a complex systems, on the nature of cultural evolution. Faced with the major challenges that humanity will have to address in the decades to come, this new paradigm invites us to change our conception of causality by shifting our attention from state change to process change and to abandon a widespread notion of 'local' causality in favour of complex systems thinking. It also highlights the importance of a better understanding of the influence of social networks, recommendation systems and artificial intelligence on our future collective dynamics and social cognition processes. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Unifying the essential concepts of biological networks: biological insights and philosophical foundations’. }

    abstract = { One of the research questions in ALife that could contribute greatly to social sustainability issues is how dynamic metastates of a complex system may be sustained through continual adaptive changes, or suppleness (Bedau, 1998). The idea of sustainability by suppleness is fundamentally different from conventional ideas of sustainability by robustness or resilience, and it is directly linked to open-endedness, a topic that has recently attracted significant attention in the ALife community (Taylor et al., 2016). Understanding and implementing mechanisms of suppleness and open-endedness may provide novel perspectives of many of today’s socio-economic, socio-ecological and socio-technological problems that call for new strategies to cope with inevitable environmental/contextual changes. This short essay provides a non-exhaustive list of research questions on this topic and encourages ALife researchers to play a leading role in this interdisciplinary collaboration endeavor. }

    abstract = { Cities are pervasive and they are some of the most powerful ecosystems of the Anthropocene. They have been around for almost 10000 years, and by the year 2050 most humans will be living in a city. Although it is known that cities have an impact to different scales, from the very local to the whole Earth System, its implications are far from being understood. Studying cities as organismic systems has been a productive strategy and favourable to complex adaptive systems analyses. However, the organismic view is to a great extent metaphorical, focusing exclusively on human activity, instead I argue for an approach that actually considers life processes as constitutive to them. In this extended abstract I suggest a conceptual framing for a synthetic approach to cities in which life processes are paramount for their understanding. Specifically, I will focus on two aspects: 1) the human-teleological component of cities and 2) the role of life processes organisationally closing the city, and bringing forth a self-generated unity and identity and the conditions for its own evolution. I believe that due to the increasing interest of the ALife community in tackling social issues, ALife unique insights and methods can be of great value in understanding cities and dealing with the social-ecological challenges they pose. A definition of cities from a synthetic perspective can help the ALife community to put into action its epistemic arsenal. }
