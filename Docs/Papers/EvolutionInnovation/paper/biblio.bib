   abstract = {Although simulation models of socio-spatial systems in general and agent-based models in particular represent a fantastic opportunity to explore socio-spatial behaviours and to test a variety of scenarios for public policy, the validity of generative models is uncertain unless their results are proven robust and representative of 'real-world' conditions. Sensitivity analysis usually includes the analysis of the effect of stochasticity on the variability of results, as well as the effects of small parameter changes. However, initial spatial conditions are usually not modified systematically in socio-spatial models, thus leaving unexplored the effect of initial spatial arrangements on the interactions of agents with one another as well as with their environment. In this article, we present a method to assess the effect of variation of some initial spatial conditions on simulation models, using a systematic geometric structures generator in order to create density grids with which socio-spatial simulation models are initialised. We show, with the example of two classical agent-based models (Schelling's model of segregation and Sugarscape's model of unequal societies) and a straightforward open-source workflow using high performance computing, that the effect of initial spatial arrangements is significant on the two models. We wish to illustrate the potential interest of adding spatial sensitivity analysis during the exploration of models for both modellers and thematic specialists.},

        abstract = {In this article, we bridge the disconnect between how spreading processes propagate and evolve in real life and the current mathematical and simulation models that ignore evolutionary adaptations. We propose a mathematical theory that reveals the effects of evolutionary adaptations on spreading processes in complex networks and highlights the shortcomings of classical epidemic models that do not capture evolution. Our work provides substantive developments to the classical theory of network epidemics and paves the way for exploring depths and revealing insights on the emergence phenomenon.A common theme among previously proposed models for network epidemics is the assumption that the propagating object (e.g., a pathogen [in the context of infectious disease propagation] or a piece of information [in the context of information propagation]) is transferred across network nodes without going through any modification or evolutionary adaptations. However, in real-life spreading processes, pathogens often evolve in response to changing environments and medical interventions, and information is often modified by individuals before being forwarded. In this article, we investigate the effects of evolutionary adaptations on spreading processes in complex networks with the aim of 1) revealing the role of evolutionary adaptations on the threshold, probability, and final size of epidemics and 2) exploring the interplay between the structural properties of the network and the evolutionary adaptations of the spreading process.},
